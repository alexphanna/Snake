# Snake

Snake was one of my first major personal programming projects when I was learning C# in my sophomore year of highschool. Therefore, I decided to recreate it to learn Python and Tkinter. This also doubled as a second new experience because it is my first program written using GitHub Codespaces and the [Light-weight Desktop](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src/desktop-lite) devcontainer.
